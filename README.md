## Distracted Driver Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

### Description

This repository contains code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect distracted drivers based on images. The dataset consists of images of drivers in various states of distraction, such as texting, talking on the phone, or adjusting the radio.

### Data Preprocessing

The code begins by downloading and extracting the dataset, which contains images of distracted drivers. It then preprocesses the images by resizing them to a uniform size of 100x100 pixels and normalizing the pixel values to the range [0, 1].

### Data Augmentation

To increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization, the script utilizes data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zooming, and horizontal flipping.

### Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture is defined using the Keras Sequential API. It consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction. Dropout layers are incorporated to prevent overfitting. The model concludes with fully connected layers and a softmax activation function for multi-class classification.

### Training

The model is trained using the training data generated by the ImageDataGenerator. Early stopping is employed as a callback to prevent overfitting and improve efficiency. The training process monitors the validation loss and stops training if no improvement is observed after a certain number of epochs.

### Evaluation

After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a separate test dataset. Performance metrics such as accuracy and loss are computed to assess the model's effectiveness in detecting distracted drivers.

### Predictions

Using the trained model, predictions are made on a test dataset to classify images of drivers into different distraction categories. The predictions are stored in a CSV file along with the corresponding image names.

### Visualization

The distribution of predicted classes is visualized using a bar plot, providing insights into the model's performance across different distraction categories.
